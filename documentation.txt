Overview:
    This was another last-minute rushed project so it' snot at the level I want it to be at to be at. It's good as a starter but not much else. I will continue to update mmy portfolio until I consider it "good."
    
    Until then, here is what I have as of now:
    
    -HTML:
        > Pretty much everything is in a div.
        > Embedded Resume using <embed> tag
        > Navigation links send you to specific part of page but nav covers title
        > "Resume" section includes source for arrow image
        
    -CSS:
        > Using Skeleton framework
        > Simple design meant look professional
        > (Mostly) Responsive
        > Updated display of mail form
        
    -PHP:
        > Used mail form exercise
        
    -JavaScript:
        > Shows / hides resume
        > Animates image next to "Resume"
